> The Scripting IDE and API for Minecraft

Are you tired of developing plugin in Java, working on the unnecessarily huge project, or checking the grammar while using Skript? Then, try this out.

## What is this project
This project makes you easily create an actual **plugin** *(not a script)* without learning Java. This requires some knowledge, but it is not that difficult.

## Coding Guideline
 - This project is divided into 3 parts.
   - **ProjectRedstone-IDE** Located at the root directory, this actually creates plugins.
   - **ProjectRedstone-API** Located in `ProjectRedstone-API` folder, this offers methods for the created plugins and manages them, on the server-side. *(currently only has sponge edition)*
   - **ProjectRedstone-DeveloperAPI** Located in `src\projectredstone\ide\api`, this offers small library for the API.
- The UI must be intuitive and easy for beginners to access.
- The IDE should be lightweight and use minimal libraries.
- *I am not English speaking, so please contribute to this README.*
